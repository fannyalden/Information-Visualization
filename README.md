# Information-Visualization
A project in the course TNM048 Information Visualization at Link√∂pings University.


Description
A large set of data containing complex relationships between airports and flight routes in the United States has been used to develop an interactive information visualization web-application. By using a map with trajectories and a bar chart, a visualization over flight delays per weekday for each airport was created. The application can be used as an analyse tool to draw conclusions about flight delays, in order to reduce or avoid them.
